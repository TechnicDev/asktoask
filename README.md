# Ask to ask

You probably had a conversation with a friend or colleague about a problem you were facing, and they asked you "can I ask you a question?" and you said "sure, go ahead". This conversation could have been simplefied if they just asked you the question directly. This is way you know the question allowing you to answer it directly when you have the chance to do so, instead of waiting for them to tell you what it is they want to ask you.

This repository hosts the website [asktoask.net](https://asktoask.net) which is a simple website explaining this issue. This repository is public and open to contributions, so feel free to modify any files and submit a pull request.
